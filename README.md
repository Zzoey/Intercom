The task is basically finding a list of customers from a pool satisfying certain conditions.

Source code is in folder 'src'. Corresponding tests for the source code can be found in 'tests'.

Files:

1. "config.py" - Configuration of Dataset path
2. "data.py"   - Read and preprocess dataset
3. "haversine.py" - Haversine formula to calculate distance
4. "main.py"     - Main Function that returns the output.

Usage :

cd src/
python3 -B main.py

Note : The project follows the basic structure for python projects along with "pep8" coding standards.

Thank you!
